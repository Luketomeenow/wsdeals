# Custom In-App Dialer Solution

## The REAL Solution to Avoid Desktop App

After multiple approaches, this is the **definitive solution** that completely avoids the Dialpad desktop app from opening.

---

## ❌ What Didn't Work

### Attempt 1: Dialpad iframe
- **Problem**: Dialpad's web interface has deep links (`dialpad://`) that trigger the desktop app
- **Result**: "Open Dialpad?" dialog still appears

### Attempt 2: Direct API + iframe
- **Problem**: API call triggers desktop app, iframe still has deep links
- **Result**: Desktop app still launches

### Attempt 3: URL parameters only
- **Problem**: Still loading Dialpad's web interface with deep links
- **Result**: Desktop app prompt persists

---

## ✅ What DOES Work: Custom Dialer

### The Solution:
**Build our own dialer interface** that:
1. ❌ Never loads Dialpad's web interface (no iframes, no deep links)
2. ✅ Uses **only** Dialpad's REST API for call initiation
3. ✅ Shows a custom UI we fully control
4. ✅ Call rings your Dialpad device (browser extension, mobile, or desk phone)
5. ✅ **No desktop app involvement whatsoever**

---

## 🎨 How It Works

### Component: CustomDialer
**Location**: `src/components/calls/CustomDialer.tsx`

### User Experience:

```
Click "Call" Button
       ↓
Select Outbound Number (Main/CA/NY)
       ↓
Custom Dialer Opens (Full-Screen Modal)
       ↓
Shows:
  - Phone number being called
  - "From: [selected number]"
  - "Calling..." status
  - Animated calling indicators
       ↓
Behind the scenes:
  - Calls Dialpad API directly
  - NO web interface loaded
  - NO deep links triggered
       ↓
Your Dialpad Device Rings
  - Browser extension (if installed)
  - Mobile app (if logged in)
  - Desk phone (if configured)
       ↓
You answer on your device
       ↓
Custom Dialer shows:
  - "Connected" status
  - Call duration timer
  - Mute button
  - End call button
       ↓
No Desktop App Ever Opens! ✅
```

## 💻 Technical Implementation

### API Call (The Magic):
```typescript
// This is the ONLY interaction with Dialpad
const response = await fetch('https://dialpad.com/api/v2/calls', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    to_number: phoneNumber,      // Who to call
    from_number: fromNumber,      // Which line to use
    external_id: dealId,          // For tracking
  }),
});
```

**What happens:**
1. API receives request
2. Dialpad's backend initiates call
3. **Your Dialpad device rings** (browser extension/mobile/desk phone)
4. **NO desktop app is involved**
5. You answer on your device
6. Call connects

### Custom UI Components:
```typescript
// Status Display
{callStatus === 'calling' && (
  <div>Calling...</div>
  <div>Answer on your Dialpad device</div>
)}

// Duration Timer
{callStatus === 'connected' && (
  <div>{formatDuration(callDuration)}</div>
)}

// Call Controls
<Button onClick={endCall}>
  <PhoneOff /> End Call
</Button>
```
