## Important Notes

1. The normalization function first converts to lowercase and trims
2. Then it replaces `/` or `-` with ` / ` (space-slash-space)
3. Then it looks up in the mapping table
4. If not found, falls back to `not contacted` as safe default

## Testing

When bulk uploading, check browser console for:
```
[BulkImport] âœ“ Stage mapped correctly: { original: "...", canonical: "...", valid: true }
```

When dragging deals, check browser console for:
```
[DragDrop] Updating deal stage: { displayLabel: "...", normalized: "...", willSaveTo: "..." }
[DragDrop] Successfully updated stage
